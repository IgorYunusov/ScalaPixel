# Algorithms

It has 3 available Algorithms

* Nearest Neighbors - The classical algorithm, nothing special here
* [hqx](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hqx)               - An algorightm using a lookup table and search for pattern to guess the form the pixel is trying to represent
* [xBrz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel_art_scaling_algorithms#xBR_family)              - My personal favorite, gives results like hqx with better smoothing


# Features

* Load and Save images
* Adjust scales
* Mix different algorithms
* Compare the result of different mixs of algorithms
